Done:
Changed empennage sizing: S_h = 3.007 m^2 (total), S_v = 1.855 m^2
Corrected airfoil difference at root and tips.
Canard camber location all set to 0.2 (instead of 0.1 at root and 0.2 at tip)
Added landing gear.
Added VTOL configuration w/ landing gear


Naming:
NP = no propeller & mount
LG = with landing gear extended
VTOL = propeller pointing downwards
